## Technical Experience
### Backend Engineer(Intern) | Fortunito LLC
- Led a 3-person team, overseeing the end-to-end design and deployment of an OAuth2-based authentication service through an open source Keycloak for Fortunito accounts. 
- Utilized the Spring framework and Docker as microservice to ensure robust and scalable security measures. 
- Developed a RESTful API for Fortunito accounts, enabling seamless interactions with third-party websites. 
- Crafted a Node.js-based demo website to effectively showcase the capabilities of OAuth2 and the RESTful API.
- Prioritized client communication for requirements, conducted code reviews for quality, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Full-stack Engineer (Intern)  |  Silicon Valley Chinese Basketball Association
- Developed a user-friendly [registration page](http://svcsa.org/bbseason/21/apply) using Layui and ThinkPHP, integrated RESTful API for streamlined registrations. 
- Optimized backend verification processes, reducing manual intervention by 80%. 
- Collaborating with a team, applying agile methods to optimize MySQL database by refactoring two critical data tables and rewriting backend server’s queries to enhance overall system performance by 50%. 

### Electrical Engineer (Full-time)  |  East China Electric Power Design Institute
- Electrical designing: Collaborated with a team of engineers to design electrical systems for thermal power plants.
- As the sole programmer in the quality control team, designed and delivered a C# .NET-based management software, alone, with SQL Server, for constructors to manage cables and reels on construction sites.
- The program was widely adopted, with over 60% of electrical engineers in the institute using it. 
- Resulting in a nearly 20% reduction in cable waste for each project, which helped the company save nearly 1 million dollars during 2018-2020. 

## Projects
### High-available Hotel Booking Website
*keywords: AWS, Docker, JUnit, Load balancing, Auto scaling, CI/CD*

- Developed a Dockerized full-stack web application to emulate a hotel booking website and deployed it on AWS. 
- Backend: Java/Jetty. Engine: Velocity Engine. Fronted: Bootstrap 5 and Ajax. Automation Testing: JUnit.
- Configured DNS settings to point a personal domain to Elastic-IP through AWS Route 53 and secured it with SSL. 
- Utilized ELB and ASG to handle increased traffic to the website. Monitored application performance using CloudWatch. 
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes using CodeBuild.  
Distributed Computing & File System  |  HDFS, Go, gRPC, Distribute computing, Multithread	May 2023
- Created and deployed a HDFS-inspired Distributed File System prototype using Go. 
- Featuring robust fault tolerance, multi-threading, highly scalability, data replication, and metadata management. 
- Designed and implemented a MapReduce framework that seamlessly integrated with the DFS, providing efficient task execution, job scheduling, resource allocation, along with a load balancing system.
- The system was deployed on a cluster server with a centralized name node and up to hundreds of storage nodes. 
- Employing both TCP and gRPC as communication protocols to facilitate data exchange.
